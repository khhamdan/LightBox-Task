# Overview

This is 30 minutes of coding.
After that time, send me the codesandbox URL again.
We evaluate code quality and implementation of best practices and patterns. So focus on code quality over quantity. Use JavaScript functions freely.

# Requirement

-   Simple UI
    # Three Lights(boxes)
    # Two Buttons("Previous" and "Next")
-   The lights are initially off.
-   When the user presses "Next", generate three new random colors on the boxes and put them in history.
-   When the user presses the "Previous", the history will be rendered.

Bonus:
